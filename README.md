# Multi-Tier Application Deployment on AWS (Lift and Shift)

This project (from the DevOps Udemy Course by Imran Teli) demonstrates a Lift and Shift migration of the Vprofile application from the VirtualBox environment to AWS. The following steps provide a detailed guide for the setup and configuration required for a successful migration.

## Requirements
- AWS Account
- AWS CLI installed and configured
- Maven installed
- Knowledge of AWS services such as EC2, S3, IAM, Route 53, and Auto Scaling
- SSH client

## Architecture
The architecture for this project includes the following components:
1. **EC2 Instances**: Hosting the application.
2. **S3**: Storing the application artifact.
3. **IAM Roles and Policies**: Managing access permissions.
4. **Route 53**: Managing DNS records.
5. **Application Load Balancer (ALB)**: Distributing traffic across EC2 instances.
6. **Auto Scaling Group**: Automatically scaling the number of instances based on demand.

## Steps
### 1. Create Security Groups and Key Pairs
**Security Groups**: Configure security groups to control inbound and outbound traffic to your AWS resources. Ensure the necessary ports are open.

**Key Pairs**: Generate key pairs to enable secure SSH access to your EC2 instances.

### 2. Launch EC2 Instances
Launch EC2 instances to host your application. Select the appropriate instance type based on your applicationâ€™s resource requirements.

**Verify Services**:
- Check the status of services using: `systemctl status servicename`
- Verify open ports using: `ss -tulnp | grep portnumber`


### 3. Configure Route 53
Set up a hosted zone in Route 53 for DNS management. Create records for your backend servers using their private IP addresses to facilitate internal communication.

**Steps**:
- Navigate to Route 53 in the AWS Management Console.
- Create a new hosted zone for your domain.
- Add A records for your backend servers with their private IP addresses.


### 4. Build the Application
- Edit the `application.properties` file to specify the appropriate domains for the `vprofile` application.
- Build the application using Maven: `mvn install`. This will generate the deployable artifact (`vprofile-v2.war`).

### 5. Store the Artifact in S3
- **Create IAM User**: Create an IAM user with full S3 access and generate access keys.
- **Configure AWS CLI**: Configure the AWS CLI with the generated access keys using: `aws configure`
- **Create S3 Bucket**: Create an S3 bucket to store the artifact: `aws s3 mb s3://some-bucket-unique-name`
- **Upload Artifact**: Upload the artifact to the S3 bucket: `aws s3 cp target/vprofile-v2.war s3://some-bucket-unique-name/`

### 6. Deploy the Artifact
- **Create IAM Role**: Create an IAM role that grants EC2 instances access to S3. Attach this role to your Tomcat instance.
